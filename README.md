This respository is temporary and will be closed later. It contains all the supplementary materials for the thesis titled "An agent-based model for the transmission dynamics of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Tunisia ". Files include:

`S1 Model Code` - A GAMA project that contains both code (**Model.gaml**) and inputs (**includes**). It is implemented in GAMA 1.8.1. When start runing code, please first create a GAMA workspace in your computer, and then import the whole Leishmaniasis project at User models. Or you can create a new project and import **Model.gaml** and **includes** seperately.

`S1 Method` - Detailed explanation about the steps of Design of Experiment.

`S1 Result` - A xlsx file that calculates the standard deviations of 50 different random seeds.

`S2 Result` - Model calibration. Regression analysis is conducted in this xlsx file.

`S3 Result` - Sensitivity analysis. Regression analysis is conducted in this xlsx file.

`S4 Result` - Simulation outputs for two rodent movement type (thoughtful movement and random movement).
